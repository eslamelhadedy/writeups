# Nebula - Level 14

### About ###

>This program resides in /home/flag14/flag14 . It encrypts input and writes it to standard output. An encrypted token file is also in that home directory, decrypt it :)
>
>To do this level, log in as the level14 account with the password level14 . Files for this level can be found in /home/flag14.

### Solution ###

The method of encryption has to be deducted. 

```
level14@nebula:/home/flag14$ ./flag14 -e
aaaaaa
abcdef
level14@nebula:/home/flag14$ ./flag14 -e
abcdef
acegik
evel14@nebula:/home/flag14$ ./flag14 -e
fedcba
ffffff
```

From the previous examples, the encryption appears to be a simple shift of characters.

If `i` is the position of a given character in the string to encrypt and `p` the position of the same character in the ASCII table, then the output is the character at the position `i+p` in the ASCII table.

The following script in Python decrypts the string encrypted with the aformentioned algorithm.

```python
def decrypt(token):
    i = 0
    dtoken = ""
    for l in token:
      dtoken += chr(ord(l)-i)
      i += 1
    return dtoken

  print decrypt("857:g67?5ABBo:BtDA?tIvLDKL{MQPSRQWW.")
```

The flag is `8457c118-887c-4e40-a5a6-33a25353165`
